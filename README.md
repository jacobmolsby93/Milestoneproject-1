First Time Visitor Goals
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
I want visitors to come to my page and see a clear and well-worked webpage. 
By achieving this I have chosen the styling of my website to be straight forward. using a navigation bar from bootstrap that will be responsive.
For first-time users, they will have a clear understanding of how to navigate through the page to easily find the content that they are looking for. We learned from the course, the 3 click rule. To be able to navigate throughout the page and find what you are looking for in no more than 3 clicks.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When you come to my webpage there should be a redline throughout all pages that make navigation simple and understandable.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As this is a portfolio website, I want my visitors to be well informed about what I am and what I do. The website itself should act as a testimonial to my visitors.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li style="font-weight: bold;">
Returning Visitor Goals
</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
As a returning visitor, I want to easily access the portfolio and contact page. I have achived this with the help from bootstrap and its navigation bar so that the users can easily navigate throughout the page with a single click.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As a returning visitor, I want to see the type of services offered on the page and how that will help me in future business aspects.

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Further Testing</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The Website was tested on the following browsers:
<strong>Google Chrome.
Mozilla Firefox.
Safari.</strong>
</li>
<br>
<li>
The website has been viewed on my bigger laptop, 16" screen. Along as my smaller 13" plus my iPhone 8s. my brother has viewed the page on his iPhone Xs.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Mainly the testing was done to see if there were any bugs in the CSS. Checking that all the elements appear in the order in which I want.
</li>

</ul>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Known Bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>
One bug that has been noticed is, on the Portfolio Page. On certain devices, the text-overlay when you hover over the items. The overlay does not always align with the images. Its not alot but a few px.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Another bug is that on some devices. On the contact page. the Send button at the bottom of the contact form. Does not appear white, but grey instead.
</li>
<br>
<li>
On the Service page for some reason, On some devices the margin between the main background image and the elements beneath it gets to large. mainly when viewed on google chrome, does not seem to happen on firefox which i have been using during this development.
</li>
<br>
<li>
During my last mentor session, my mentor pointed out that when the page goes into the mobile version the dropdown menu does not close unless you press one of the links. this was an easy fix of deleting duplicates of the bootsrap script.
</li>

</ul>
