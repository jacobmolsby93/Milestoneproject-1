# Welcome to my first solo project with The Code Institute!

## The project idea i chose to do is a portfolio website, to showcase myself and the skills that i have aquired.

<p>
Given that i have just started, with this exciting journey of programming. My previous project are limited to no-existing, but this website will serve as a portfolio in future aspects. 
For now, the projects and links are fake and will not showcase my knowledge.

The design i have chosen is minimalistic, with dark tones. Illustrations are taken from pexels and unplash.
